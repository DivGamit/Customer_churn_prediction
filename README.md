# Customer_churn_prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning. The solution includes a comprehensive pipeline involving data preprocessing, model training, and deployment with CI/CD integration. The project utilizes Random Forest for classification and is deployed as a Streamlit web app inside a Docker container.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data, including one-hot encoding and handling missing values.
Model Training: Building a Random Forest classifier to predict customer churn.
Deployment: Full deployment pipeline using Streamlit for interactive visualization, Docker for containerization, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation.
CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment.

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit)
Docker (Containerization)
GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
Machine Learning: Random Forest Classifier
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
